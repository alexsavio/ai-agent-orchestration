Run a **Coordinator**, several **architects** and many **workers** (Claude Code or Codex) as agents in [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) panes that you can watch. The installer puts the skills, watchers, hooks and status line into `~/.claude`. It starts no Coordinator, architect or worker; you open those sessions yourself. The installer also sets up Herdr and its Radar plugin, and with `ORCH_WATCHERS_SERVICE="1"` it starts the watcher services.

## 1. Install

You need macOS or Linux, [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with the `ListAgents`, `SendMessage` and `Monitor` tools, `git`, `jq`, `python3` and `curl`. `gh` (logged in with `gh auth login`) is needed for the PR watchers. Codex CLI is optional.

```bash
s=$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/combinaut/ai-agent-orchestration/main/install.sh) && bash -c "${s:?empty download}" _
```

It clones this repo to `~/.claude/ai-agent-orchestration`, links the files into `~/.claude`, adds the hooks and status line to `~/.claude/settings.json`, and installs [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) 0.9 or newer with the Radar plugin. Pick another env with `--env <name>` after the final `_`, or skip the env step with `ORCH_ENV="none"` in `~/.claude/orchestration.env`. If it prints `PATH setup`, add the line it shows to your shell startup file and open a new shell.

The installer never edits your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. When its sections are missing it tells you to paste [`snippets/CLAUDE.md.snippet`](snippets/CLAUDE.md.snippet).

## 2. Set it up

The first run copies [`config/orchestration.env.example`](config/orchestration.env.example) to `~/.claude/orchestration.env`. On a terminal it asks only for the six keys in the table below, when they are empty or still a `<…>` placeholder, and offers a default it found on the machine. Enter takes the default, `-` leaves the key empty. A key that has a value is never asked or changed, and no other key is asked. Without a terminal it asks nothing and lists the keys to fill. Set at least:

| Key | Set it to |
|---|---|
| `ORCH_PR_REPOS` | the `owner/name` repos to watch, space separated (for example `acme/webapp`) |
| `ORCH_PR_AUTHOR` | your GitHub login (`@me` works) |
| `ORCH_CODEX_WORKER_MODEL`, `ORCH_CODEX_SMART_MODEL` | a Codex model name each. Fill both even without Codex: `/coordinate` and `/architect` stop while either is still a placeholder |
| `ORCH_HERDR_BIN`, `ORCH_HERDR_SOCKET` | Herdr's executable and socket; needed for the watcher services |

Restart Claude Code afterwards so it loads the hooks and skills. Every key is listed in [`docs/settings.md`](docs/settings.md). For watcher services, see [`docs/watchers.md`](docs/watchers.md).

To update, run the install command again. At session start a hook prints `ai-agent-orchestration setup out of date, run install.sh` when you are behind. Nothing updates on its own. The clone is never updated over local work: with uncommitted edits or commits that are not on origin the installer prints `REFUSED: … has local changes` and stops. It never stashes or resets. Put your changes in a PR, then run it again.

## 3. Use it

### Start the Coordinator

There is one Coordinator per machine. In a Herdr pane of its own, start Claude Code and run:

```text
/coordinate
```

It lists the `Architect::<area>` sessions, introduces itself, tags its pane `role=coordinator`, binds itself as the inbox target (`bind-self.py`, again after every recycle) and arms one Monitor on `~/.claude/coordinator/watchers/feed-monitor.sh`. You talk to the Coordinator. It relays your orders to architects and gives you one overview. It never merges, undrafts, assigns reviewers, deploys or pushes. Details: [`skills/coordinate/SKILL.md`](skills/coordinate/SKILL.md).

### Start an architect

Open a session named `Architect::<area>`, run `/architect`, and give it the initiative:

```text
/architect Move the acme/webapp billing page to the new API
```

The architect splits the work into tasks. It does not edit code. For each task it opens a Herdr workspace with its own git worktree, starts a worker (Claude or Codex, picked per task), tags the worker with `owner`, and pastes `~/.claude/worker-reports/machine-rules.md` into the brief. Edit the project-specific list at the end of that file first. The architect verifies every report, and merges only a PR you name. Details: [`skills/architect/SKILL.md`](skills/architect/SKILL.md).

Workers, recycles and handoffs: [`docs/workers.md`](docs/workers.md).

### The to-do pane

Architects keep a `## Waits on the user` list in `~/.claude/coordinator/status/<architect>.md`. The user-todo watcher merges those lists into `~/.claude/coordinator/user-todo.md`. To show it in a pane:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/coordinator/user-todo.py --follow
```

`user-todo.py` without `--follow` writes the file once. In the pane, press a number then Enter (or click) to jump to the item. `n` and `p` change page. A jump removes the item from the list. An empty list reads `Nothing waits on you.`

### Heavy jobs

Many sessions share one machine. `heavy-slot` caps how many test runs, browsers or builds run at once (`ORCH_HEAVY_SLOTS_MAX`):

```bash
heavy-slot take acme-tests -- npm test   # waits up to 1800 s for a free slot, then runs
heavy-slot count                         # slots in use
heavy-slot list                          # names, pids, ages, stale records
```

If the cap stays full, `take` prints `NEED SLOT`. Details: [`docs/heavy-slot.md`](docs/heavy-slot.md).
