Run a team of Claude Code and Codex agents you can watch: one **Coordinator**, **architects** that plan, and **workers** in visible terminal panes. You talk to the Coordinator; it relays your orders to the architects, who split the work and start workers (Claude Code or Codex) in their own git worktrees. [Radar](https://github.com/combinaut/herdr-radar) groups each worker under its architect from the worker's `owner` tag. One-line install for macOS and Linux.

The installer puts the skills, watchers, hooks and status line into `~/.claude`. It starts no agent; you open those sessions yourself. The panes come from an env adapter ([`env/README.md`](env/README.md) shows how to add one). [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) is the one shipped, so the installer also sets up Herdr and Radar.

## 1. Install

You need macOS or Linux, [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) with the `ListAgents`, `SendMessage` and `Monitor` tools, `git`, `jq`, Python 3.11 or newer and `curl`. `gh` (logged in with `gh auth login`) is needed for the PR watchers. Codex CLI is optional.

```bash
s=$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/combinaut/ai-agent-orchestration/main/install.sh) && bash -c "${s:?empty download}" _
```

It clones this repo to `~/.claude/ai-agent-orchestration`, links the files into `~/.claude`, adds the hooks and status line to `~/.claude/settings.json`, and runs the env adapter, which for `herdr` installs [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) 0.9 or newer with the Radar plugin. Pick another env with `--env <name>` after the final `_`, or skip the env step with `env = "none"` under `[install]` in `~/.claude/orchestration.toml`. If it prints `PATH setup`, add the line it shows to your shell startup file and open a new shell.

The installer adds a marked orchestration block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Later runs replace the text between those markers. If you already pasted the older unmarked sections, it leaves them alone and tells you how to wrap them once with the markers from [`snippets/CLAUDE.md.snippet`](snippets/CLAUDE.md.snippet); any custom text inside the markers will be replaced on the next run.

## 2. Set it up

The first run copies [`config/orchestration.toml.example`](config/orchestration.toml.example) to `~/.claude/orchestration.toml`, or converts an existing `~/.claude/orchestration.env`. On a terminal it asks for the keys below while they are empty or a `<…>` placeholder, offering a default it found; Enter takes it, `-` leaves the key empty. Without a terminal it lists the keys to fill. Set at least:

| Key (prompt) | Set it to |
|---|---|
| `[pr] author` (`ORCH_PR_AUTHOR`) | your GitHub login (`"@me"` works); the watchers find the repos from the open workspaces |
| `[models] codex_worker`, `codex_smart` (`ORCH_CODEX_WORKER_MODEL`, `ORCH_CODEX_SMART_MODEL`) | a Codex model name each. Fill both even without Codex: `/coordinate` and `/architect` stop while either is a placeholder |
| `[herdr] bin`, `socket` (`ORCH_HERDR_BIN`, `ORCH_HERDR_SOCKET`) | Herdr's executable and socket; needed for the watcher services |

Settings for one repo (big-repo guard, legacy scan and its rules, focus) go in that repo's `.orchestration.toml` (committed, shared), or `.orchestration.local.toml` for your own (keep it out of git). An exported `ORCH_*` variable beats both files. Restart Claude Code afterwards so it loads the hooks and skills. Every key: [`docs/settings.md`](docs/settings.md). Watcher services: [`docs/watchers.md`](docs/watchers.md).

To update, run the install command again. At session start a hook prints `ai-agent-orchestration setup out of date, run install.sh` when you are behind. Nothing updates on its own. The clone is never updated over local work: with uncommitted edits or commits that are not on origin the installer prints `REFUSED: … has local changes` and stops. It never stashes or resets. Put your changes in a PR, then run it again.

## 3. Use it

### Start the Coordinator

There is one Coordinator per machine. In a Herdr pane of its own, start Claude Code and run:

```text
/coordinate
```

It lists the `Architect::<area>` sessions, introduces itself, tags its pane `role=coordinator`, binds itself as the inbox target (`bind-self.py`, again after every recycle) and arms one Monitor on `~/.claude/coordinator/watchers/feed-monitor.sh`. You talk to the Coordinator. It relays your orders to architects and gives you one overview. It never merges, undrafts, assigns reviewers, deploys or pushes. Details: [`skills/coordinate/SKILL.md`](skills/coordinate/SKILL.md).

### Start an architect

Open a session named `Architect::<area>`, run `/architect`, and give it the initiative:

```text
/architect Move the acme/webapp billing page to the new API
```

The architect splits the work into tasks. It does not edit code. For each task it opens a Herdr workspace with its own git worktree, starts a worker (Claude or Codex, picked per task), tags the worker with `owner`, and pastes `~/.claude/worker-reports/machine-rules.md` into the brief. Edit the project-specific list at the end of that file first. The architect verifies every report, and merges only a PR you name. Details: [`skills/architect/SKILL.md`](skills/architect/SKILL.md).

Workers, recycles and handoffs: [`docs/workers.md`](docs/workers.md).

### The to-do pane

Architects keep a `## Waits on the user` list in `~/.claude/coordinator/status/<architect>.md`. The user-todo watcher merges those lists into `~/.claude/coordinator/user-todo.md`. To show it in a pane:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/coordinator/user-todo.py --follow
```

`user-todo.py` without `--follow` writes the file once. In the pane, press a number then Enter (or click) to jump to the item. `n` and `p` change page. A jump removes the item from the list. An empty list reads `Nothing waits on you.`

### User questions

Every user question gets a pane. Create its Markdown file under `~/.claude/coordinator/questions/`, then run `ask-user-question <slug> <file>`; it stacks below the to-do pane without taking focus. Number keys or `t` record an answer, which the shared feed Monitor reports. Run `ask-user-question close <slug>` after handling it to close the pane and remove its files.

### Review PRs

`/review-prs` lists the open PRs that request your review, bucketed by CI, conflicts and drafts. `/review-prs watch` reports each change and starts a Codex review (`ORCH_CODEX_WORKER_MODEL`) in a Herdr pane for every PR that is ready; Codex posts the review and ends its turn, and the pane closes through `close-pane.sh`, so the workers watcher reports it as closed, not dead. Scope: `--repo`, `--org`, `--all`, else the current repo, else `watchers.pr_scope`. Details: [`skills/review-prs/SKILL.md`](skills/review-prs/SKILL.md).

### Heavy jobs

Many sessions share one machine. `heavy-slot` caps how many test runs, browsers or builds run at once (`ORCH_HEAVY_SLOTS_MAX`):

```bash
heavy-slot take acme-tests -- npm test   # waits up to 1800 s for a free slot, then runs
heavy-slot count                         # slots in use
heavy-slot list                          # names, pids, ages, stale records
```

If the cap stays full, `take` prints `NEED SLOT`. Details: [`docs/heavy-slot.md`](docs/heavy-slot.md).
