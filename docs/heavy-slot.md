# Heavy jobs: `heavy-slot`

Many sessions share one machine. Too many test runs, browsers or builds at once can exhaust open files and memory. `heavy-slot` is a shared cap of `ORCH_HEAVY_SLOTS_MAX` jobs.

```bash
heavy-slot take acme-tests --note "first-run.bats for PR 106" -- npm test   # waits up to 1800 s for a free slot, then runs
heavy-slot count                         # slots in use
heavy-slot list                          # names, pids, ages, notes, stale records
```

`--note <text>` says what the job is. It shows in `list` and in every event line (`note=-` without it). The note is cut to one printable line of 60 characters.

A slot is a file in `~/.claude/heavy-slots/` that holds the job's pid. `take` removes it when the job ends.

- If the cap stays full, `take` prints `NEED SLOT`.
- `take` exits 73 when the slot directory is not writable (for example in a sandbox). Run it again with write access to that directory.
- Never create slot files by hand. Stop jobs by pid, not with `pkill`.
- The audit reports `STALESLOT` for a file whose pid is gone.
- The balance watcher uses the same cap.

## Feed lines

`take` appends one line per event to `<slot dir>/.events`. The balance watcher reads that file each pass, removes it, and turns each line into a feed line (`balance: SLOT ...`). Every line names the slot, the pid, and the note.

| Event | When | Example | Feed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WAIT` | The job found no free slot (once per job) | `SLOT WAIT acme-tests pid=40 slots=4/4 note=first-run.bats for PR 106` | FYI log |
| `FAIL` | The job exited non-zero, also a code above 128 (a kill from outside, such as the OOM killer, looks the same as `exit 137`) | `SLOT FAIL acme-tests pid=41 code=1 elapsed=93s note=...` | FYI log |
| `KILLED` | `take` received a signal and stopped the job | `SLOT KILLED acme-tests pid=41 code=143 elapsed=12s note=...` | Action line |
| `RUNLONG` | The job ran past `heavy_slots.long_run` (once per job; 0 turns it off) | `SLOT RUNLONG acme-tests pid=41 elapsed=1800s note=...` | Action line |

Only action lines reach the Coordinator's Monitor and native delivery; see [watchers](watchers.md).

What the spool guarantees. Each line is one `write(2)` on an `O_APPEND` file with a leading epoch, so lines of jobs that end together do not interleave. A job writes at most one `KILLED` or `FAIL` line, and none when it passes; a process left over after a normal exit is cleaned up without a line. A line can still be lost: when it is written at the instant the watcher renames the file, when the watcher crashes between the claim and the feed write, when the file is over 64 KB (the job then adds nothing), or when it is older than 15 minutes at the next watcher pass (it is dropped, not replayed). If the watcher cannot claim or read the file, balance reports `BALANCE READFAIL slot-events`.

The rules for workers and the Coordinator are in [Architecture](architecture.md#-heavy-slots).
